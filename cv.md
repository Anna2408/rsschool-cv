## About Me: 

I devoted my whole life, starting from the age of 8, to music. But now, having matured, I realized that I want to change my life and become a sought-after specialist. My choice fell on the frontend, because I like to see the result of my work immediately and the fact that people directly interact with what I do.

## Skills:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git

## Code Example:

Implement a function named generateRange(min, max, step), which takes three arguments and generates a range of integers from min to max, with the step. The first integer is the minimum value, the second is the maximum of the range and the third is the step. (min < max)

Task
Implement a function named

```
generateRange(2, 10, 2) // should return array of [2,4,6,8,10]
generateRange(1, 10, 3) // should return array of [1,4,7,10]
```
Note
```
min < max
step > 0
```
the range does not HAVE to include max (depending on the step)

``` 
function generateRange(min, max, step){
  let res = [];
    for (let i = min; i <= max; i = i + step) {
      res.push(i);
    }
  return res;  
}
```
